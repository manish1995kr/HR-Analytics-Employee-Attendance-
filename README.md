# HR-Analytics-Employee-Attendance-
In this project i make a power Bi Dashboard.
I got the excel file of the employee attendance from the HR Department.
By using the data i import in the power bi software and getter some info about the employee like work from home, work from office and sick leave. How many percentage of people work from home at which day or which month so by know we can fix the meeting like if employee prefer WFH on Friday and most of the employee come on office on Tuesday then we can set over meeting on Tuesday not on Friday. It will also help in project decision. And other info like this which help to the company.
